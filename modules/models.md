# Model Optimization

## Claude Opus 4.5
- Allow extended thinking; avoid over-constraining
- Read files thoroughly before proposing changes
- Minimal modifications unless explicitly asked
- No extra files or abstractions without clear need

## Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Be explicit about requirements
- Specify expected output format clearly
- Break complex tasks into discrete steps
- More directive prompting yields better results

## Subagent/Skill Compatibility
- These defaults are inherited unless overridden
- Subagent-specific rules take precedence
- Skills auto-load based on task context match
